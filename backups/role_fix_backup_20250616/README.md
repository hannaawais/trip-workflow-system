## System Architecture

### Database-First Architecture with ACID Compliance
**Single PostgreSQL Instance** with enterprise-grade reliability:
- **Full ACID Compliance**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability guaranteed for all operations
- **Complete Transaction Atomicity**: Individual and bulk operations wrapped in atomic transactions
- **Real-time Budget Tracking**: Atomic budget validations prevent over-allocation
- **Zero Hardcoded Logic**: All business rules stored in database, not application code
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Immutable audit trail for regulatory compliance

**Database-Driven Operations**:
- **Workflow Steps Table**: Manages all approval sequences dynamically
- **Permission Validation**: Real-time checks based on database relationships
- **Budget Protection**: Atomic budget allocation and deallocation with rollback protection

### Permission System
- **Role-Based Access**: Employee, Department Manager, Project Manager, Finance, Admin
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Context-aware access based on assignments and active roles
- **Workflow Integration**: Approval rights determined by database workflow steps

### Budget Management
