- Associated with departments and project managers
- Contains expiry dates for time-limited projects

### Trip Requests
- Core entity for transportation requests
- Contains trip details (origin, destination, purpose, etc.)
- Tracks request status through the approval workflow
- Associates with either departments (Ticket trips) or projects (Planned trips)
- Contains cost calculation information
- Tracks kilometers for distance-based cost calculations

### Admin Requests
- Represents administrative requests outside of trip requests

- Administrative request types available: Transportation Plan Not Listed, Payment Delay Justification, Trip Payment Value Discrepancy, Other Administrative Request

### Manager
- Inherits Employee permissions
- Can approve/reject department trip requests
- Can view department budget information
- Can view department trip history
- Can switch between Manager and Employee roles
- Department Managers specifically approve Ticket trips
- Project Managers specifically approve Project trips

## Workflow Processes

### Trip Request Workflow

The trip request workflow defines how transportation requests move through the system from creation to completion.

#### Creation Phase
1. Employee creates a new trip request
2. Employee selects trip type (Ticket, Planned, or Urgent)
3. For Ticket trips, employee's department is automatically selected
4. For Planned trips, employee selects from all active projects
5. Employee enters trip details (origin, destination, purpose, date)
6. Cost is calculated automatically if using KM-based calculation
7. Employee submits the request

#### Approval Phase
1. **Department Approval** (for Ticket trips)
   - Department manager reviews trip details
   - Department manager approves or rejects with comments
   - If approved, moves to Finance approval

2. **Project Approval** (for Planned trips)
   - Project manager reviews trip details
   - Project manager approves or rejects with comments
   - If approved, moves to Finance approval

3. **Finance Approval**
   - Finance reviews trip details and budget impact
   - Finance approves or rejects with comments
   - If approved, trip status becomes "Approved"

#### Completion Phase
1. Trip is executed
2. Finance marks trip as "Paid" when payment is processed
3. Trip is archived in history for reporting

### Administrative Request Workflow

Administrative requests follow a separate workflow for non-trip administrative needs.

#### Administrative Request Types by Role

**Employee Role:**
- Transportation Plan Not Listed
- Payment Delay Justification  
- Trip Payment Value Discrepancy
- Other Administrative Request

**Manager Role:**
- All Employee request types plus:
- Budget Increase (for departments/projects they manage)
- New Project Setup

**Finance/Admin Role:**
- All request types system-wide

#### Administrative Request Visibility Rules

**Employee:**
- Can view only their own administrative requests

**Manager:**
- Can view their own administrative requests
- Can view administrative requests from users in departments they manage
- Can view administrative requests related to projects they manage (regardless of requester's department)

**Finance/Admin:**
- Can view all administrative requests system-wide

#### Administrative Request Approval Workflow

1. User creates administrative request with subject and description
2. Finance reviews and approves/rejects administrative requests
3. Administrative requests are approved/rejected by Finance only
4. Users can view status of their administrative requests based on visibility rules above

#### Manager Assignment Types

The system has a single "Manager" role that can be assigned to manage:
- **Department Management**: Managers assigned to oversee one or more departments
- **Project Management**: Managers assigned to oversee one or more projects  
- **Hybrid Management**: Managers who oversee both departments AND projects

Administrative request visibility combines both department-based and project-based permissions for comprehensive oversight.

## Budget Tracking and Calculations

The budget system manages financial resources and calculates trip costs.

### Budget Allocation
- Administrators set department budgets
- Administrators set project budgets
- Budgets can be adjusted as needed with proper authorization

### Cost Calculation Methods
1. **Kilometer-Based Calculation**
   - Trip distance (KM) × Current KM rate = Cost
   - KM rates can change over time, system uses the rate effective on the trip date
   - If no KM rate exists for a trip date, cost remains 0

2. **Fixed Cost Entry**
   - Manual cost entry for special cases
   - Requires authorization to override automatic calculations

### Budget Impact
- Approved trips deduct from appropriate budget (department or project)
- Budget tracking shows remaining available funds
- Reports provide insights into budget utilization
- Budget warnings trigger when thresholds are approached

### Recalculation Process
- When KM rates change, administrators can trigger cost recalculation
- Recalculation can apply to specific rate periods or all applicable trips
- Only affects trips with KM-based calculations
- Does not affect trips already marked as paid

---

## KM Rate System

The kilometer rate system manages the per-distance costs for transportation calculations.

### Rate Configuration
- Administrators set KM rates with specific effective date ranges
- Rates include a value (amount per kilometer)
- Rates have effective-from and effective-to dates
- Rates can include descriptions for reference

### Rate Application
- The system automatically applies the appropriate rate based on trip date
- When multiple rates exist, the system selects the rate effective on the trip date
- If no rate exists for a date, the cost remains 0
- Rate changes do not automatically affect existing trips unless recalculation is triggered

### Rate History
- The system maintains a history of all KM rates
- Historical rates are used for reporting and auditing
- Expired rates are kept for reference but not applied to new trips

---

## Integration Points

The system has several integration points with other systems and services.

### File Storage Integration
- Document upload and storage for trip attachments
- Project document management

### Email Notifications
- Notification capabilities for status changes
- Approval request notifications
- Budget alert notifications

### Authentication System
- Potential integration with organizational SSO
- Role synchronization with HR systems

### Reporting Services
- Integration with external reporting tools
- Data export capabilities for analysis
